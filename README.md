## 🧰 Technology Stack

Below is an overview of the technologies used in the **Airbnb Clone Project**, along with their purpose and role within the system architecture.

### 🐍 Django
A high-level Python web framework used to build secure and scalable backend services.  
- Provides structure for handling requests, routing, and responses.  
- Simplifies development with built-in authentication, ORM, and admin panel.  
- Used to create RESTful APIs for managing listings, users, and bookings.

### 🗄️ PostgreSQL
A robust, open-source relational database used for storing structured data.  
- Stores user accounts, property details, and booking records.  
- Ensures data integrity and supports complex queries efficiently.  
- Integrates seamlessly with Django through its ORM.

### ⚙️ GraphQL
An API query language that enables flexible data retrieval.  
- Allows clients to request only the data they need.  
- Reduces over-fetching and under-fetching of data.  
- Simplifies communication between frontend and backend.

### 🖥️ React.js
A JavaScript library for building interactive and responsive user interfaces.  
- Powers the frontend for users to browse, book, and manage listings.  
- Connects to backend APIs to display real-time data.  
- Enhances UX through reusable components and dynamic rendering.

### 🎨 Tailwind CSS
A utility-first CSS framework used to design responsive and modern layouts.  
- Provides pre-defined styling utilities to build clean, consistent UI.  
- Accelerates design workflow and ensures mobile responsiveness.  

### ☁️ AWS (Amazon Web Services)
Used for hosting, deployment, and cloud storage.  
- Hosts both backend and frontend for global accessibility.  
- Provides secure, scalable infrastructure and data storage solutions.  
- Ensures reliability and performance for live users.

### 🧪 Postman
A tool for API development and testing.  
- Used to test API endpoints, verify responses, and debug issues.  
- Ensures that backend services work as expected before frontend integration.

### 🔐 JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
A compact authentication method for secure user sessions.  
- Handles login tokens to verify user identity.
